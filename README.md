# Xamarin guide

## Creating the project

We are going a Xamarin forms app that fetches a list of items retrieved from the internet. Each row of the list will display an item with some text content and a thumbnail. We are not going to developer neither the JSON API nor the thumbnail server. Instead, we'll use a free JSON generator for developers [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and a free image generator [https://picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/).
